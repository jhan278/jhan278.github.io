            <b><p style="font-size:150%; font-family:monospace; color:darkblue;">Titanic is a 1997 film by James Cameron. As the title suggests, it is a sad love story of two men and women based on the sinking of the most famous sinking ship, the Titanic. It's a very popular movie that probably there are not even people who haven't seen. When I was little, I was very impressed with this movie. There are a lot of funny scenes, but there are also touching scenes, so it's really great movie.</p></b>
