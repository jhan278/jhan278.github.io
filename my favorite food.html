	      <b><p style="font-size:150%; font-family:monospace; color:rebeccapurple;">One of my favorite foods is the Chinese spicy hot pot, which is also very popular in my home country, Korea. This food is a spicy soup dish with meat, various vegetables, and a Chinese spicy spice in broth.I like spicy and addictive food, so I eat it very often here as well. Second, I like salmon sushi because salmon is my favorite fish. Some people hate it because of its fishy taste, but I really like sashimi and sushi. There are also places near campus where you can eat sushi at a reasonable price.</p></b>
